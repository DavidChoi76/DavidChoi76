### Welcome to My GitHub. ðŸ‘‹

I'm YoungDon Choi, a principal researcher at K-water AI research Lab (
https://github.com/Kwater-AILab)
. I have worked at K-water (https://www.kwater.or.kr/eng/about/sub02/kwaterPage.do?s_mid=1099) since 2003 with many experiences such as dam operation, water resources survey and planning, water technology strategy, and water information system.
Currently, I'm working at  K-water AI research Lab to apply AI in water resources fields.

I did my PhD from 2017 to 2021 at the UVA Hydroinformatics research group (https://uvahydroinformatics.org/team/) in University of Virginia (https://www.virginia.edu/). This is my Dissertation (https://doi.org/10.18130/g9tg-0c69), google scholar(https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VCyCE5QAAAAJ&hl=en) and Resume(https://github.com/DavidChoi76/profile/blob/main/YD_Choi_17June2022.pdf)

#### These are my current research. :nerd_face: Focusing :thinking:

1. ðŸ”­ Application of neuralhydrology and other AI technologies for upstream and downstream analysis for dam operation
 - https://github.com/realtime-dam-operation-using-AI
  
2. ðŸŒ± Long-Term Water Demand Forecasting 
  
3. ðŸ‘¯ Satellite Rainfall Distribution using Machine Learning
  
4. ðŸ”­ Urban Inundation Forecasting using Machine Learning as Surrogate Model

5. ðŸŒ± Application of NeRF and 3DGS in Water Infrastructures

6. ðŸ‘¯ Drought Quantification using Social data such as Newspapers


#### Study for Deeper Understanding. :nerd_face: Focusing :thinking:

1. Differentiable Modeling
